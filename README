jab_normalmap (December 27, 2006)
---------------------------------
This is a small OpenGL application that demonstrates normal mapping, a
lighting technique that can cause flat surfaces appear to have depth.
The normal mapping is accomplished with a fragment program written in Cg
and compiled into the ARB_fragment_program shader language. The application
is written in C and also requires SDL.

To build the program, just run 'make' in the jab_normalmap directory. This
will create a jab_normalmap executable that you will then be able to run.
You may have to edit the Makefile if your GL headers/libraries are not under
the /usr/X11R6 directory. The build.sh script will re-compile the fragment
program using cgc before running make. This program was developed and
tested on Slackware Linux.

This program is released under a BSD-style license. You can find the
copyright notice and license conditions at the beginning of any of the
source code files (such as main.c).
